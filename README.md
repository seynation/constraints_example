# Constraints Example

This project demonstrates a basic Flutter application with responsive design and state management.

## Features

- Responsive design using `SafeArea`, `Expanded`, `MediaQuery`, and `LayoutBuilder`.
- Simple registration form with state management.
- Display of entered data on a separate screen.

## Responsive Design

The app adjusts its layout based on the screen size:
- For wide screens (width > 600 pixels), it uses a `Row` to display content side-by-side.
- For narrow screens, it uses a `Column` to stack the content vertically.

## State Management

The registration form collects user details and navigates to a second screen to display the entered data. The state is managed using a `StatefulWidget`.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Use `flutter run` to start the application.
